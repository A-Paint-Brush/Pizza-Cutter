# Pizza Cutter

This is a small project I made while taking a break from the development of my _Flappy Bird_ clone. I guess it might help with teaching kids fractions?

## Installation

To install this program, you can either download the source code and run it in an environment with `tkinter` installed, download the [Windows executable](https://github.com/A-Paint-Brush/Pizza-Cutter/raw/main/Releases/Pizza%20Cutter.exe), or build it with Pyinstaller yourself.

## Instructions

After opening the program, you should see a pizza, and a spinbox underneath. Simply change the number in the spinbox to set how many slices you want the pizza to be cut in. You can also press the up and down arrow keys or click the arrows to change the number in the spinbox. `360` is the maximum value you can set the spinbox to. To be honest, this limit is already _much_ larger than necessary.

## Credits

All the pizza art in this project is drawn by me :)
